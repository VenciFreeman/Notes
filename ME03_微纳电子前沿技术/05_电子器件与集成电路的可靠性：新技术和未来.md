## IC industry and scaling

### Transistor Pre-history

#### Transistor and IC

- Concept: Surface field-effect transistor
  - Lilienfeld (1930)
  - Heil (1935)
- First Ge-based transistor in Bell lab (1947)
- First IC (1BJT+ 3R+1Capacitor)
  - Jack Kilby (1958)
- Made the first planar IC with lithographically patterned metal interconnect (4BJT+2R)
  - Robert Noyce (1959)

#### CCD: A Killing Factor to the Film

- First CCD
  - Boyle and Smith (1969)
- First Digital camera (1991)
  - DCS100, USD13000, 5kg

#### The Disappearance of Mechanical Watch

- CMOS electronic wristwatch
  - ISSCC (1971)

### IC Industry is the Key to the Info-eco Society

  - 整机性能决定市场竞争力
- 电子产品
  - 芯片、软件决定整机性能
- 集成电路
  - 芯片决定软件性能
- 
  - 工艺决定芯片性能
- 
  - 装备和材料决定工艺水平

### Most Important Concept in IC: Scaling

- Transistor counts have doubled every 18 months for the past three decades
- No other human artifact has been fabricated in larger numbers

### Moore's Law: What does this mean

$$
2^{33.33}=10,797,662,668
$$

### Scaling: Key factor for 5G

- 28 nm makes 4G baseband IC technologically feasible by solving three issues
  - Higher speed to support higher data rate (100Mbps)
  - low power consumption (500 pj/bit) making total power less than 1W
  - Die size fit into about 2cm^2^
- 5G baseband ==> 10 times higher data rate to 1 Gbps
  - Power consumption: $0.5nJ/bit\times 1Gbps=0.5W,4~paraller\rightarrow 2w$
  - Size: $2cm^2\times 10\times 4=80cm^2$

### Scaling is Not Easy

- Higher driving
- 
- 

#### Boosters for Driving Current

$$
I=q\times n\times v\times A\\
n: Carrier~Density\\
v: velocity
$$

Increasing electron/hole mobility in MOSFETs ==> Driving current increases

- Booster 1: Strain silicon Technology (应变硅技术，Intel 90 nm(2003))
- Booster 2: High mobility material

#### Boosters for Scaling Down

$$
Q=CV\\C=\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r\frac{A}{T_{OX}}
$$

MOSFET becomes "resistor" at very small L: Drain controller with more than one side.

#### FINFET, Nanowire and nanosheet

### Enables for "A lot of Devices"

### 摩尔定律快停止了么

- 从晶体管比例微缩而言，确实快停止了
- 从单位面积算力提升而言，还有很多创新，很多新技术可以做
  - 架构创新
  - 三维集成
  - 新的范式

## The 'Old' but 'New' Issue: Reliability

### Reliability Issues in the Route of Scaling

### Empirical Bath Curve

- Failure rate: How many faild

```c
'Bathtub curve' = 'Early Fails' + 'Wear-out'
```

#### Trend for the Device Reliability

#### Reliability from Another Angle

##### Power Supply Voltage

##### Electric Field

##### Power Density

### Importance of Reliability

## Degradation Mechanisms and Reliability Assessment in State-of-art Technologies

### Variability: New Challenge in the Nano-era

### Operating Pattern for IC Industry

### Acceleration Test for Lifetime Prediction: Deterministic

### Foundry & Fabless Business Model

### Classical Approach Becomes more difficult

### Deficiency from Classical Approach

#### Cross-layer Reliability Solution

- Reliability should not be guaranteed by manufactures, but need to consider real circuit operations
  - Reliability-aware circuit design
  - Device/Technology

#### State-of-the-art DTCO

## Key Degradation Mechanisms

### Gist of Gate Oxide Breakdown

#### Phases of Gate Dielectric Breakdown

### Time-dependent Variation: Random Telegraph Noise

## New Dimension in Emerging Applications

## Research in Post-Moore Era

## Conclusion
